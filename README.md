## Overview

The **DepositBox** plugin allows players to deposit specific items (e.g., paper) into a dropbox, logging the deposits and removing the items from the game. This is useful for creating events or competitions where players turn in items for rewardsâ€”similar to dog tag events in Twitch Rust servers.

### Features

- Only designated items can be deposited.
- Deposits are logged and removed from the game world.
- Leaderboard-friendly: works with plugins like `UpdateLeaderboard`.
- Low memory overhead: deposit totals are no longer calculated on every deposit.
- Configurable deposit box skin, item type, and deposit limits.
- Supports automated reward distribution (e.g., Bitcoin payouts based on leaderboard rankings).

Once installed, players with permission can use `/depositbox` to receive a special deposit box. Deposits made into this box are tracked and logged to the data folder.

## Installation

1. Upload `DepositBox.cs` to your server's `/oxide/plugins/` directory.
2. Reload the plugin:

   ```bash
   oxide.reload DepositBox
   ```

3. Grant permission to users:

   ```bash
   oxide.grant user <username> depositbox.place
   ```

## Configuration

A config file is generated at `/oxide/config/DepositBox.json`:

```json
{
  "DepositBoxSkinID": 3337967028,
  "DepositItemID": -932201673,
  "MaxDepositLimit": 1000000
}
```

- `DepositItemID`: The item players can deposit (default is paper).
- `DepositBoxSkinID`: Unique skin to identify deposit boxes.
- `MaxDepositLimit`: Players exceeding this limit (based on the last leaderboard update) cannot deposit more.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** The plugin only checks deposit limits based on the last generated summary. To update totals, run the `/depositsummary` command or let the `UpdateLeaderboard` plugin call it automatically.

## Permissions

- `depositbox.place`: Allows a player to use `/depositbox` and place a box.
- `depositbox.admincheck`: Allows a player/admin to run `/depositsummary`.

## How It Works

- Deposits are tracked and logged in `oxide/data/DepositBoxLog.json`.
- Totals and rewards are calculated **on-demand** when the summary is generated.
- Deposit limits are enforced using the last summary snapshot (`DepositBoxSummary.json`).
- This shift from live tracking to batched summarization greatly improves plugin performance.

## Summary Output

Running `/depositsummary` creates:

- `DepositBoxSummary.json`: Full deposit totals and reward percentages.
- `DepositBoxClaims.json`: Reward amounts per player.
- `DepositBoxSummary.csv`: Human-readable CSV for external analysis.

These are saved to `oxide/data/DepositBox/`.
